[ ] Embed rendering into application 
    [x] make renderer class
    [x] Shader program class
        [x] implement the "construct" method in Shader.
            - The only thing the program will keep track of is the Shader program unique id
                stored as a Shader struct.  
                Shader struct will have a construct method which needs vert/frag source
                and an id field for calling the active program
    [ ] VBO VAO all that !!
        [x] make vbo object 
        [x] make vao object and container in renderer 
        [x] how to architect the tightly coupled things so its an easy rendering switch?
        [ ] why doesnt the two triangles from different vertices work?
        [ ] Can I do 2 VBOS specifying differnt triangles in 1 VAO which draws both triangles?
    [ ] Loading vertex data from disk (lua? or python integratnio for generating vertex info?)
    [ ] get a better idea for how the shaders work !!


!TODO
[ ] Shader hot reloading
    - i have source stored in the file system so it can construct and pull from disk on the fly.  might be slow
[ ] Error info for load_shaders and load_vertex_data
    - in Renderer.cpp init function, both of the aforementioned functions are void 
        should figure out how to get debug info in case creating VBOs/VAos fails
