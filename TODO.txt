[ ] Embed rendering into application 
    [x] make renderer class
    [x] Shader program class
        [x] implement the "construct" method in Shader.
            - The only thing the program will keep track of is the Shader program unique id
                stored as a Shader struct.  
                Shader struct will have a construct method which needs vert/frag source
                and an id field for calling the active program
    [ ] VBO VAO all that !!
    [ ] get a better idea for how the shaders work !!


!TODO
[ ] Shader hot reloading
    - i have source stored in the file system so it can construct and pull from disk on the fly.  might be slow
